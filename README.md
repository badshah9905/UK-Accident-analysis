# Accident Analysis
## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing accident data using Power BI to provide insights into various factors contributing to road casualties. By visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs), we aim to identify patterns and trends that can help in improving road safety and reducing accidents.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
1. Total Casualties: The overall number of individuals involved in accidents.
2. Total Fatal Cases: The number of fatalities resulting from accidents.
3. Total Serious Cases: The count of serious injuries sustained in accidents.
4. Total Slight Cases: The number of minor injuries resulting from accidents.
5. Total Casualties by Vehicles: The distribution of casualties based on the type of vehicles involved.
Detailed KPI Analysis with Charts
6. Total Casualties by Nearest Police Force: Visual representation of casualties segmented by the nearest police force, highlighting areas with higher accident rates.
7. Total Casualties in Different Light Conditions: Analysis of casualties under various lighting conditions, such as daylight, twilight, and darkness, to understand the impact of visibility on accident rates.
8. Casualties by Month: Monthly trend analysis to identify peak periods for accidents, aiding in targeted intervention strategies.
9. Casualties by Day of the Week: Insights into which days of the week have higher casualty rates, helping in planning road safety campaigns and resource allocation.
10. High Casualties Due to Surface Conditions: Examination of how different road surface conditions (e.g., dry, wet, icy) contribute to accident severity.
11. Total Casualties Due to Junction Control: Analysis of casualties at various junctions, understanding the role of traffic control measures in accident occurrence.
## Objectives
* Identify Trends and Patterns: Use data visualization to uncover trends and patterns in accident data.
* Improve Road Safety: Provide actionable insights to policymakers and law enforcement agencies for improving road safety measures.
* Resource Allocation: Assist in the efficient allocation of resources to areas with higher accident rates.
* Targeted Interventions: Develop targeted interventions based on the analysis of different factors contributing to accidents.
* Tools and Technologies
Power BI: Used for data visualization and dashboard creation to present the analysis in an interactive and comprehensible manner.
Data Sources: Accident data obtained Kaggle.
By leveraging the power of Power BI, this project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of accident data, offering valuable insights to enhance road safety and reduce casualties.
